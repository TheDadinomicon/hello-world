# hello-world
new to web development, following the intro guide. Freecodecamp.com sent me here to set up an account to use while working on the courses they provide. Iam 100% new to this and i have not used HTML since MySpace when i was 14... 9 years ago. any tips, pointers, or advice for someone as green as me I'm all ears.
A little bit about me, I am a 23 year old single father. I currently work as a door to door salesman for the local cable, internet, and phone company. My work history ranges from fast food to three years in HVAC. My son just recently turned 4 and started daycare/preschool and our life seems to be in constant flux while simultaniously standing still. The reason I have decided to break into this new feild is my need to create and problem solve, can you see how these needs may not be satisfied selling cable TV? You could argue that I do indeed solve problems like saving money on media services or getting people internet service but its just not enough! So after hours of research on the topic, im still here moving forward! wish me luck!
